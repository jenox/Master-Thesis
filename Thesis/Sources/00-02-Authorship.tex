\centerline{\textbf{Acknowledgements}}
\vspace{0.25cm}

First of all, I would like to thank my advisor, {Dr.~Tamara Mchedlidze}, for making this project possible through our weekly meetings and fruitful discussions, valuable feedback, and pointers in the right direction.

I am also grateful to the Algorithmics Group of {Prof.~Dr.~Dorothea Wagner} for the interesting courses over the last years, for giving me the opportunity to write this thesis, for their valuable insights early on in the project, and for the overall pleasant atmosphere.

Last but by no means least, I would like to thank my parents and grandparents and my good friend Johannes Hubert for their unfailing support and encouragement that kept me motivated on this final stretch, and for lending me some cores to help me crunch numbers for the evaluation of the framework discussed in this thesis.

Thank you!
