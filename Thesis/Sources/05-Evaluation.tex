\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{chap:evaluation}

In this chapter, we experimentally evaluate our implementation of the framework discussed in \crefrange{chap:visualizing-static-input-graphs}{chap:visualizing-dynamic-input-graphs}. Our evaluation is driven by the following research questions:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Which quantitative measures best capture the quality of the maps generated by our algorithm in terms of
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item accuracy?
	\item our understanding of locally fat regions?
	\end{enumerate}
	\item What is the quality of the maps generated by our algorithm according to these quality metrics?
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item How does this quality change based on the size and other properties of the input graph?
	\item How does this quality change over time as dynamic updates are incorporated?
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

First, we discuss a variety of possible quality metrics from literature and how they can be applied to our framework in \cref{sect:quality-metrics}.
We pick two metrics that best capture the quality of the generated maps according to research question 1.
In \cref{sect:test-case-generation} we present the algorithm we use to generate randomized test instances on which we perform our experimental evaluation.
In \crefrange{sect:implementation-and-experiment-setup}{sect:experimental-evaluation}, we conduct the actual experimental evaluation on a large number of test instances and see how the maps generated by our algorithm perform, thereby answering research question 2.
Eventually, in \cref{sect:exemplary-maps} we showcase a range of maps produced by our framework.
