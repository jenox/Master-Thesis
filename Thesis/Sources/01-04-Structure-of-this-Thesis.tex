\section{Structure of this Thesis}
\label{sect:structure-of-this-thesis}

In \cref{chap:preliminaries}, we present preliminary definitions of various concepts that we base our algorithms and discussions on, some of which were already brought up earlier in this chapter without formal definitions.
We then define our algorithmic pipeline for static inputs in \cref{chap:visualizing-static-input-graphs} and adapt it to dynamic inputs in \cref{chap:visualizing-dynamic-input-graphs}, discussing possible implementations of the pipeline's phases along the way.
In \cref{chap:evaluation}, we discuss different quantifiable measures to assess the quality of the visualizations produced by our implementation and apply those in an experimental evaluation on a large number of test inputs.
Eventually, in \cref{chap:conclusion}, we summarize our framework and its shortcomings and explore how future research can improve upon it.
