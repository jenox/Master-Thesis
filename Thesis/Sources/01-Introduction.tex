We live in a world with an abundance of data.
Data for which it is no longer possible for humans alone to work through, or to make sense of, and data that is only going to increase in volume in the years to come.
As the amount of data we work with soars to previously uncharted heights and analyzing it seems increasingly infeasible, visualizations retain their ability to help discover useful information, to illustrate relationships in large sets of data, and to communicate them with others effectively.

Even in today's highly automated world, many processes still require some degree of human decision-making and interaction.
Data visualizations are a great tool to inform these decisions as the visual perception channel has the highest information bandwidth of all human senses.
In fact, we acquire more information through vision alone than through all other senses combined \cite{ware2019information}.
However, as the mountains of data that we seek to understand keep growing, the human ability to process data remains mostly constant \cite{dachsbacher2019visualisierung}.
Therefore, it becomes increasingly important to capture the most relevant aspects of the data and its trends with computer-aided visualizations.
