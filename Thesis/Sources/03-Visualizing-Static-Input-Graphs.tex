\chapter{Visualizing Static Input Graphs}
\label{chap:visualizing-static-input-graphs}

In this chapter we provide a detailed description of our problem statement, formalize it, and discuss our solution in the case of static input graphs.

Our goal is to visualize clusters of a larger graph, such as an opinion network, as an artificial map.
In this map, each cluster of the larger graph is represented by a continuous region whose area is approximately proportional to the cluster's size, and neighboring regions indicate similarities between the respective clusters.

Unlike OpMap and GMap, which have similar goals, clustering the larger graph is not part of the framework we discuss here.
Instead, we assume the larger graph is clustered externally before being fed into our framework, producing some cluster graph.
The first step of our framework takes a spanning subgraph of this cluster graph as input and builds an initial contact representation in which all regions are simple polygons.
Obviously, this isn't possible for all spanning subgraphs of the cluster graph; for example, the subgraph must be planar.
We formalize the additional requirements we impose on the spanning subgraph in a bit.
The contact representation is then tweaked, displacing the polygons' corners in such a way that their areas are approximately proportional to the clusters' weights and they have somewhat organic shapes.
To formalize this, we require two short definitions:

\begin{definition}
A contact representation in which all regions are simple polygons is called a \emph{polygonal contact representation}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Given a plane graph $G$, a polygonal contact representation of $G$ is called a \emph{polygonal dual} of $G$.
\end{definition}

Note that polygonal duals are a generalization of rectilinear duals and that, analogous to rectilinear duals, a polygonal dual can be interpreted as plane graph itself: the polygons' corners translate to vertices in this graph, and their sides translate to edges.

With these definitions in place, we can formalize the structure of our framework:
Our input is a biconnected and internally triangulated plane subgraph of a cluster graph that we call the \emph{filtered cluster graph} \clustergraph{}.
We start by forming an initial weighted polygonal dual of \clustergraph{}, the \emph{initial map} \initmap{}.
\initmap{} inherits its (face) weights from the vertices of \clustergraph{}.
We then turn \initmap{} into an $\varepsilon$-area-proportional, polygonal contact representation of \clustergraph{} for some small $\varepsilon > 0$, the \emph{$\varepsilon$-proportional map} \propmap{} of \clustergraph{}.
This is done by displacing the the contact representation \initmap{}'s vertices while preserving its planarity.
We implement this step using a force-directed algorithm.

Let's break down the requirements we impose on the filtered cluster graph \clustergraph{}:

\begin{itemize}
\item \clustergraph{} is given as a plane graph.
Obviously, \clustergraph{} must be planar such that there exists a contact representation of \clustergraph{}.
We require a planar embedding of \clustergraph{} such that the \quoted{arrangement} of the clusters or of the regions on the eventual map is predetermined.
This becomes important in \cref{chap:visualizing-dynamic-input-graphs} where we start incorporating dynamic updates into the filtered cluster graph and resulting the map graphs.
\item \clustergraph{} must be internally triangulated such that the maps \initmap{} and \propmap{} are hole-free.
Applying the map metaphor, this translates to there not being any lakes or rivers separating countries on the map.
\cref{fig:preliminaries-rectilinear-dual} illustrates how internal faces on 4 or more vertices creates holes in contact representations.
\item \clustergraph{} must be biconnected such that, in combination with the internal triangulatedness, no vertex appears on the outer face multiple times.
The region of such a vertex in the polygonal dual would need to have multiple borders to the outer face, which we specifically excluded in \cref{chap:preliminaries}.
\item \clustergraph{} must be vertex-weighted such that the map \initmap{} can inherit its vertex weights and we know what areas the polygonal regions are supposed to have in \propmap{}.
\end{itemize}

Many real-world applications, such as visualizing opinion networks, do not produce a filtered cluster graph directly.
In order for our framework to be applicable, one may need to prepend a clustering phase that turns an arbitrary input graph $G$ into a biconnected and internally triangulated plane subgraph \clustergraph{} of a cluster graph of $G$ that can then be processed by our framework:

We will now discuss our implementation of the transformation and drawing phases of the pipeline in detail.
