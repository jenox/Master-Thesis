\section{Structure of this Thesis}
\label{sect:structure-of-this-thesis}

In \cref{chap:preliminaries} we present preliminary definitions of various concepts that we will need later on, some of which were already brought up earlier in this chapter without formal definitions. We then define our algorithmic pipeline for static inputs in \cref{chap:visualizing-static-input-graphs} and for dynamic inputs in \cref{chap:visualizing-dynamic-input-graphs}. In \cref{chap:implementation} we look at possible implementations of the individual phases of the pipeline. We continue with a thorough evaluation of the visualizations produced by our implementations on a number of test inputs in \cref{chap:evaluation}. Eventually, in \cref{chap:conclusion} we discuss shortcomings of our approach and how future research can improve on it.
