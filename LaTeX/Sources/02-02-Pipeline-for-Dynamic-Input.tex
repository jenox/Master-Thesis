\section{Pipeline for Dynamic Input}
\label{sect:pipeline-for-dynamic-input}

\paragraph{Why do we need a different pipeline? Why do we use incremental versions instead of regular version + diff afterwards?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Goal: preserve mental map of user
	\item Sequence of input graphs as input and sequence of contact reps as output is bad, will not preserve mental map
	\item also allows for more efficient implementations that only look at the changes
	\item also required to support dynamic operations in an online setting, \ie{} the sequence of dynamic operations isn't known in advance. Why? Original motivation: Visualize live data.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Figure
	\item What goes in, what comes out? Sequence of operations, different per stage.
\end{itemize}
