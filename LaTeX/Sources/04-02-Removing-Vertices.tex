\section{Removing Vertices}
\label{sect:removing-vertices}

Clusters in the underlying data set can also fade and eventually cease to exist.
In this case, we want to be able to remove existing vertices of the cluster graph.
We make the same distinction here as when inserting vertices: we can remove internal vertices or vertices that lie on the cluster graph's outer face.




\paragraph{Removing Internal Vertices}

When removing an internal vertex, we must ensure that the cluster graph remains internally triangulated.
This is only the case if the vertex we want to remove has degree 3 as removing vertices with greater degree would create holes.
If one wants to a vertex with degree 4 or higher, one must first tweak the adjacencies on the inside of the cluster graph using edge flips, discussed in \cref{sect:flipping-edges}.
\Cref{fig:remove-vertex-example-internal} shows a valid removal of an internal vertex.

In order not to create holes in the contact representation, the incident faces must take over the area that the face to be removed originally occupied.
Let $x$ denote the internal vertex we want to remove and $u$, $v$, and $w$ its three neighbors.
We start by computing the paths that form the $u$-$v$-, $v$-$w$, and $w$-$u$-boundaries in the dual.
Let $p_{uvx}$ ($p_{vwx}$, $p_{uwx}$) denote the vertex where face $x$ meets faces $u$ and $v$ ($v$ and $w$, $w$ and $u$).
\Cref{subfig:remove-vertex-illustration-1} shows how these vertices might look for the example from above.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\caption{Removing an internal face $x$ incident to the faces $u$, $v$, and $w$.}
	\label{fig:remove-vertex-illustration}
\end{figure}

To remove the internal face $x$, we simply remove the its boundary to one of its neighboring faces.
In doing so, the two faces effectively merge.
In practice this works really well because large clusters don't disappear at a moment's notice, and small clusters generally occupy a very small area such that the operation is barely noticeable.




\paragraph{Removing External Vertices}

When removing vertices on the outer face along with its incident edges, we must ensure that the graph remains 2-connected afterwards.
\cref{fig:remove-vertex-example-external} illustrates a valid removal of a vertex on the outer face.
Similar to inserting vertices on the outer face, we restrict ourselves to removing vertices on the outer face that have degree 2.
If we need to remove a vertex with higher degree, the additional edges need to be removed first as discussed in \cref{sect:flipping-edges}.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[height=29mm]{Resources/RemoveVertex-Example-External-1.pdf}}

	\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[height=29mm]{Resources/RemoveVertex-Example-External-2.pdf}}
	\qquad
	\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[height=29mm]{Resources/RemoveVertex-Example-External-3.pdf}}
	\quad
	\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[height=29mm]{Resources/RemoveVertex-Example-External-4.pdf}}
	\caption{A cluster graph and a polygonal dual thereof, before (a, c) and after (b, d) removing the vertex $x$ on the outer face.}
	\label{fig:remove-vertex-example-external}
\end{figure}

This operation, too, is just a special case of the vertex removal discussed above.
Referring to the construction of the augmented dual again, with the helper vertex $v^+$ and edges $\{v^+,\cdot\}$, removable vertices $x$ on the outer face of the cluster graph lie in a triangle formed by its two neighbors $u$ and $v$ and the helper vertex $v^+$.

The construction outlined above translates 1-to-1 to removing vertices from the outer face, except one of the three neighboring faces is the implicit outer face.
In our implementation, we always remove the boundary of $x$ with the outer face and thereby transfer the area to the outer face.
