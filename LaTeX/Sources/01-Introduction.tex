We live in a world with an abundance of data. Data for which it is no longer possible for humans alone to work through, or to make sense of, and data that is only going to increase in volume in the years to come. As the amount of data we work with soars to previously uncharted heights and analyzing it seems increasingly infeasible, visualizations retain their ability to discover useful information, illustrate relationships in large sets of data, and to efficiently communicate those with others.

Even in today's highly automated world, many processes still require some degree of human descision-making and interaction. Data visualizations are a great tool to inform these descisions as the visual perception channel has the highest information bandwidth of all human senses. In fact, we acquire more information through vision alone than through all other senses combined \cite{ware2019information}.

As the mountains of data that we seek to understand keep growing while the human ability to process data remains constant \cite{dachsbacher2019visualisierung}, it becomes increasingly important to capture the most relevant aspects of the data and its trends, even with computer-aided visualizations. In the field of graph theory and graph drawing, for example, for larger graphs, global structures such as clusters and their relationships become increasingly important while the importance of local features such as  individual edges diminishes.
