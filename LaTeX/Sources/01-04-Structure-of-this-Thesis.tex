\section{Structure of this Thesis}
\label{sect:structure-of-this-thesis}

In \cref{chap:preliminaries} we present preliminary definitions of various concepts that we base our algorithms and discussions on, some of which were already brought up earlier in this chapter without formal definitions.
We then define our algorithmic pipeline for static inputs in \cref{chap:visualizing-static-input-graphs} and for dynamic inputs in \cref{chap:visualizing-dynamic-input-graphs} and discuss possible implementations of the individual phases of the pipeline.
In \cref{chap:experimental-evaluation} we conduct an evaluation of the visualizations produced by our implementations on a number of test inputs.
Eventually, in \cref{chap:conclusion}, we discuss shortcomings of our framework and how future research can improve on it.
