\section{Incremental Filtering and Embedding}
\label{sect:incremental-filtering-and-embedding}

The incremental filtering and embedding phase continues propagating the changes and translates changes of the cluster graph to changes of its filtered graph embedding: it takes a cluster graph, a sequence of operations to be applied to the cluster graph, and the embedded filtered graph of the cluster graph and outputs a sequence of operations that, when applied to the embedded filter graph, makes it an embedded filter graph of the cluster graph with the operations applied.

The pipeline supports the following operations:
%Supported operations on embedded filtered graph:
%
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Change vertex or edge weight:}
	\item \textbf{Add vertex in an internal face:} with arbitrary weight inside an inner face (and connect it to the three vertices of the triangle)
	\item \textbf{Add vertex in outer face:} adjacent to 2 or more vertices on outer face that lie on simple path
	\item \textbf{Remove internal vertex:} of degree 3
	\item \textbf{Add edge on outer face:}
	\item \textbf{Remove edge on outer face:} without violating 2-connectedness and internal triangulatedness
	\item \textbf{Flip internal edge:}
\end{itemize}
